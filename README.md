## ðŸ“– Overview  

The **AMiGA System** is part of a broader research effort within the **FOODI project**, a NASA-affiliated initiative led by the **Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM (ARCS)**.  
The projectâ€™s mission is to **facilitate the development, integration, and adoption of modern technologies** that strengthen the field of **Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)** â€” an approach to food production that leverages technology to sustainably manage light, temperature, humidity, and water use for optimal plant growth.

Within this framework, AMiGA serves as a **proof-of-concept platform** for automation, environmental sensing, and sustainable irrigation practices. It represents one of several experimental systems designed to demonstrate how **accessible, modular technology** can be applied to real-world agricultural challenges.

## ðŸŒŽ About FOODI  

**FOODI** â€” *Facilitating Overcoming Obstacles to the Development and Integration of Modern Technologies for Controlled Environment Agriculture* â€” is a multidisciplinary research program based at **ARCS, California State University, Northridge (CSUN)**.  

The initiative addresses key barriers that limit the scalability and success of CEA systems, including:
- High infrastructure and energy costs  
- Limited technical literacy and workforce readiness  
- Challenges integrating diverse sensors and automation technologies  
- Difficulty achieving consistent system performance across scales  

To overcome these challenges, FOODI combines **academic research, industry collaboration, and hands-on student innovation** to prototype new technologies and processes that make CEA more efficient, reliable, and affordable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission and Goals  

FOODIâ€™s long-term goal is to **empower the next generation of researchers and engineers** to advance sustainable agriculture through technology.  
Its objectives include:  

- Developing **modular, scalable systems** that can adapt to different cultivation environments  
- Promoting **data-driven decision-making** in water and nutrient management  
- Strengthening **education and interdisciplinary collaboration** between engineering, agriculture, and environmental science  
- Building partnerships that bridge **academia, industry, and government research**  

AMiGA contributes to this mission by exemplifying how open-source tools, sensor feedback, and intelligent automation can support **precision irrigation** and **environmental control** within research and learning environments.

## ðŸ’¡ Research Integration  

The AMiGA project demonstrates FOODIâ€™s principles in practice by focusing on:  

- **Automation and feedback control** â€“ using environmental data to drive resource-efficient irrigation  
- **Interdisciplinary design** â€“ integrating hardware, software, and agricultural expertise  
- **Education and accessibility** â€“ making advanced CEA research tools open and reproducible for student and institutional use  
- **Sustainability and scalability** â€“ supporting methods that reduce waste, conserve water, and improve reliability in food production systems  

Together, these efforts help strengthen CEAâ€™s potential as a viable, sustainable solution for future food systems â€” from laboratory prototypes to operational facilities.
